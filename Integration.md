AO has been influenced by an analysis of strengths and weaknesses of the [Annotea Project](http://www.w3.org/2001/Annotea/).

AO makes use of the PAV ontology for Provenance, Authoring and Versioning. It is also possible to use Dublin Core or Dublin Core Terms for covering provenance, we usually suggest to use both as PAV is covering all the curational aspects that are crucial for AO. The standard AO is also integrating with FOAF (Friend of A Friend).
