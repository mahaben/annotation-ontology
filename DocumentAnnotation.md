## Annotation Perspective (or Document Annotation) ##

While Annotation Set(s) are used mainly for access permissions and aggregation of Annotation items by topic, the Annotation Perspective (or Document Annotation) entity has been introduced as a collection of Annotation Set(s) mainly for reasons related to publishing. For instance, it is possible to specify which publicly available Annotation Set(s) to select for publishing in a specific context.
