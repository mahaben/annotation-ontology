## Introduction ##

The idea of Annotation Ontology (AO) is very simple yet powerful, AO allows you to:
  * Annotate:
    * **RESOURCES** such as HTML, PDF, Word, Excel, XML documents, images, videos, databases, web services, experiments data and metadata... **AND THEIR FRAGMENTS**
  * Specifying (or not) an:
    * **ANNOTATION TYPE** expressed through one of the already available  types (errata, highlight, qualifiers...) or the ones you will define (**1**)
  * With (or without) a:
    * **TOPIC** refers to a URI that identifies the subject matter of the targeted resource
  * With (or without) an:
    * **EXPECTATION** expressed by free text or better by terms from a controlled vocabulary or an ontology
  * While tracking:
    * **PROVENANCE**: who created what, when, with which software, during which process...

(**1**) When defining new types. It would be ideal for you to contribute them back to the AO community to avoid redundancies and assure interoperability between the different applications making use of AO.
